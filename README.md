# Math::Sidef

Perl interface to [Sidef](https://metacpan.org/release/Sidef)'s mathematical library.

# DESCRIPTION

Math::Sidef provides an easy interface to the numerical built-in system of [Sidef](https://metacpan.org/release/Sidef).

It supports all the numerical functions provided by:


* [Sidef::Types::Number::Number](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sidef::Types::Number::Number)

* [Sidef::Types::Number::Mod](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sidef::Types::Number::Mod)

* [Sidef::Types::Number::Gauss](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sidef::Types::Number::Gauss)

* [Sidef::Types::Number::Quadratic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sidef::Types::Number::Quadratic)

* [Sidef::Types::Number::Quaternion](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sidef::Types::Number::Quaternion)

* [Sidef::Types::Number::Polynomial](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sidef::Types::Number::Polynomial)

* [Sidef::Types::Number::Fraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sidef::Types::Number::Fraction)


The returned numerical values are returned as [Math::AnyNum](https://metacpan.org/release/Math-AnyNum) objects.

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use 5.018;
use Math::Sidef qw(factor composite prime ipow);

say prime(1e9);       # 10^9-th prime number
say composite(1e9);   # 10^9-th composite number

# Prime factorization of 2^128 + 1
say join ' * ', factor(ipow(2, 128) + 1);

# Iterate over prime numbers in range 1..100
Math::Sidef::each_prime(1, 100, sub {
    say $_[0];
});
```

# IMPORT

Any function can be imported, using the following syntax:

```perl
use Math::Sidef qw(function_name);
```

Additionally, for importing all the functions, use:

```perl
use Math::Sidef qw(:all);
```

It's also possible to import only functions for specific uses:

```
    :number        export Number functions, with Number() constructor
    :gauss         export Gauss functions, with Gauss() constructor
    :quadratic     export Quadratic functions, with Quadratic() constructor
    :quaternion    export Quaternion functions, with Quaternion() constructor
    :mod           export Mod functions, with Mod() constructor
    :poly          export Poly functions, with Poly() constructor
    :fraction      export Fraction functions, with Fraction() constructor
```

Example:

```perl
use 5.018;
use Math::Sidef qw(:gauss :quadratic);

say pow(Gauss(3,4), 10);
say powmod(Quadratic(3, 4, 100), 10, 97);
```

The list of functions available for importing, can be listed with:

```perl
CORE::say join ", ", sort @Math::Sidef::EXPORT_OK;
```

while the methods for a specific group (e.g.: quadratic), can be listed with:

```perl
CORE::say join ", ", sort @{$Math::Sidef::EXPORT_TAGS{quadratic}};
```
