# Math::Sidef

Perl interface to [Sidef](https://metacpan.org/release/Sidef)'s mathematical library.

# DESCRIPTION

Math::Sidef provides an easy interface to the numerical built-in system of [Sidef](https://metacpan.org/release/Sidef).

It supports all the numerical functions provided by [Sidef::Types::Number::Number](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sidef::Types::Number::Number).

The returned values are [Math::AnyNum](https://metacpan.org/release/Math-AnyNum) objects.

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use 5.018;
use Math::Sidef qw(factor composite prime ipow);

say prime(1e9);       # 10^9-th prime number
say composite(1e9);   # 10^9-th composite number

# Prime factorization of 2^128 + 1
say join ' * ', factor(ipow(2, 128) + 1);

# Iterate over prime numbers in range 1..100
Math::Sidef::each_prime(1, 100, sub {
    say $_[0];
});
```

# IMPORT

Any function can be imported, using the following syntax:

```perl
use Math::Sidef qw(function_name);
```

Additionally, for importing all the functions, use:
